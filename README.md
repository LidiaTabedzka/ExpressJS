# ExpressJS
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use ExpressJS in my projects for the first time.
There were 5 Tasks - a new branch on each was created.

Branch Task1 - creating a simple app to serve and overwrite files using ExpressJS.

Branch Task2 - creating a simple app to log in using ExpressJS (using endpoints, serving static files).

Branch Task3 - modifying the app from Branch Task 2 by adding middleware function using ExpressJS.

Branch Task4 - creating a simple app to log in using Google account credentials using ExpressJS and Pug template engine (not real logging yet).

Branch Task5 - modifying the app from Branch Task 4 by enabling real logging using Google account credentials (using Google API and Passport middleware).
